# BU-683-eSports-application, week 3
Revised repository for same Android development class.

Week 3 progress includes the creation of a ExpandableListView, which was a labor of love.
Furthermore, stylistic changes were added to the spinner's child pages.
Finally, orientation support was added to make application contents viewable in both portrait and landscape orientations.
